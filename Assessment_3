Task 3
(please answer in plain text)
We intend to use these queries for a reporting dashboard. How do you design the database and query for reporting performance? 

Solution:
	Partitioning -> To avoid full table scan of entire data
	Repartitioning in case of higher volume of data in a single partition
	Bucketing -> In case of data skewness among partitions
	Coalescing in case on small volume of data in each partition
